Pregnancy-related mortality rates among Black women are over three higher when compared to the rate for White women.The disparities in maternal and infant health are a manifestation of deeper social and economic injustices, which stem from systemic racism and discrimination. 

The Black Unified Mothers Program (BUMP) is a community-focused initiative that aims to empower and support Black pregnant mothers.

The program provides resources, education, and support to help Black mothers advocate for themselves and navigate the challenges they may face during pregnancy. BUMP also serves as a platform for Black mothers to connect with one another and build a supportive network.

The goal of the program is to uplift and strengthen the Black community by empowering and supporting Black mothers.
